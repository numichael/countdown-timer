What is a countdown timer
A countdown timer is a virtual clock running on a landing page. And it counts down from a certain date to indicate the beginning (or the end) of an event.

On eCommerce websites, you can use a countdown timer to display the beginning (or the end) of an offer. The purpose of the countdown timer is to urge customers to take actions such as buying products or services.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create a countdown timer in JavaScript from scratch. And you’ll learn how to use it to build a New Year countdown timer.
